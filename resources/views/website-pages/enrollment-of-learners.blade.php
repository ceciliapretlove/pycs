                  <h3>Enrollment of Learners</h3>
                  <p>Our learners at Philippine Yuh Chiau School, Inc. are not abstract beings, but of real families. The
                     cooperation of the parents / guardian in the academic and discipline formations of the learners are
                     paramount. Parents / guardian therefore are expected to work with the Administration, the Faculty and
                     the learners in the pursuit of the school philosophy, vision, and mission, core values, and Confucian
                     virtues.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each learner must be academically ready for the grade level for which he is applying. Special
                     education is NOT provided for at Philippine Yuh Chiau School, Inc. Therefore, registration and/or
                     enrollment to PYCS pledges their support and commitment to the school’s philosophy, policies and
                     regulations.
                  </p>

                           <ol>
                              <li>A learner’s registration at PYCS by his parents or guardian is considered an expression of
                                 willingness on the part of the learner and his parents / guardian to abide by all the rules and
                                 regulations prevailing in the school.
                              </li>
                              <li>A learner’s registration means that he is enrolling for the entire school year.</li>
                              <li>A learner who does not live with his parents should have a legal guardian who is duly
                                 authorized by the parents to assume the parental authority and responsibilities towards the
                                 learner.
                              </li>
                              <li>PYCS adopts a policy of selective admission of its learners following prescribed standards of
                                 academic background / preparation, potential for development and general acceptance of the
                                 philosophy, vision, and mission of the school. It, therefore, reserves the right to refuse an
                                 applicant who, it believes, fails to meet the criteria for admission.
                              </li>
                              <li>The school accepts only qualified applicants for enrollment. Every applicant for enrollment
                                 must comply with the requirements and follow standards operating procedures.
                              </li>
                              <li>No old learner is allowed to enroll unless all requirements are presented at the scheduled time
                                 of enrollment.

                              <li>Learners with academic deficiency are required to take summer remedial classes before they
                                 are re-admitted the following school year.
                              </li>
                              <li>Learners who were suspended twice within the school year, provided that the length of each
                                 suspension is at least three (3) days, and those committed grave offenses shall not be re-
                                 admitted.
