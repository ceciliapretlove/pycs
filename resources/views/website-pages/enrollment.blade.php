                  <h3>Class periods and learning cycle</h3>
                  <p>PYCS, as it is highly engaged to improve the learners’ study habit and learning commitment took the
                     first big step to embrace the six (6)-day learning cycle. Yuh Chiauians will be counting the days of
                     school year as part of a new rotating six-day learning cycle. With this new class schedule, the biggest
                     advantages are consistency, continuity of learning, flexibility, and shorter periods.

                  <p>The enrolment and class size in every subject of each private school shall be determined by the School
                     Principal taking into account the total absorption capacity of its facilities, level of instruction, the nature
                     of the subject, and such other factors as may be conducive to the learning process.
                  </p>
                  <p>From a psychological viewpoint – in terms of how learners learn – what matters is the number of
                     learners who are physically present actively interacting among themselves and with the teacher.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Enrollment of learners</h3>
                  <p>Our learners at Philippine Yuh Chiau School, Inc. are not abstract beings, but of real families. The
                     cooperation of the parents / guardian in the academic and discipline formations of the learners are
                     paramount. Parents / guardian therefore are expected to work with the Administration, the Faculty and
                     the learners in the pursuit of the school philosophy, vision, and mission, core values, and Confucian
                     virtues.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each learner must be academically ready for the grade level for which he is applying. Special
                     education is NOT provided for at Philippine Yuh Chiau School, Inc. Therefore, registration and/or
                     enrollment to PYCS pledges their support and commitment to the school’s philosophy, policies and
                     regulations.

                              <li>A learner’s registration at PYCS by his parents or guardian is considered an expression of
                                 willingness on the part of the learner and his parents / guardian to abide by all the rules and
                                 regulations prevailing in the school.

                              <li>A learner’s registration means that he is enrolling for the entire school year.</li>
                              <li>A learner who does not live with his parents should have a legal guardian who is duly

                                 learner.

                                 philosophy, vision, and mission of the school. It, therefore, reserves the right to refuse an
                                 applicant who, it believes, fails to meet the criteria for admission.
