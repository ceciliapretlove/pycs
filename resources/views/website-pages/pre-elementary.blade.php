               <p>The early years of a child offer a unique opportunity to shape his development. Four to six (4 – 6) year-
                  old learners gather to learn what sounds letters make to counting to 10, they develop appreciation of the
                  things around them through discovery, and by the time they get to Kindergarten, they should be ready to
                  speak and write in longer phrases and sentences, and by the time they graduate from Kindergarten, they
                  will have learned a lot. In addition to academics and social skills, PYCS’ Pre-Elementary curriculum
                  works on critical writing, speech, and fine motor skills.
               </p>
               <p>The Pre-Elementary Education of Philippine Yuh Chiau School, Inc. provides both academic and
                  personal programs that will prepare the learners in the formal schooling. The various program offerings
                  provide learning experiences to develop basic literacy, numeracy, scientific, and social skills which are
                  developmentally appropriate to the very young learners.
               </p>
              
                  <div class="overview-box">
                  <h4>Numeracy</h4>
                  <p>Numeracy is about basic number concepts and skills generally emerge before school entry. It is important to
                     promote the development of these competencies in very young learners because these competencies are often
                     predictive of learners’ future school achievement.
                  </p>
                  <p>Supplementing how learners apply numeracy concepts and skills are through everyday activities like
                     counting, looking at shapes, and talking about sizes. The numeracy skills are also developed through play
                     and singing number songs.

                  <h4> Reading / Language</h4>
                  <p>Pre-reading strategy is given emphasis to help very young learners of Philippine Yuh Chiau School to read
                     and use the language until they reach Kindergarten. Few examples of this strategy include: phonological
                     awareness<em> (ability to distinguish sounds from one another)</em>, letter recognition, listening skills, learning new
                     words, print recognition <em>(knowing what books are and how enjoyable books are)</em>, reading aloud activities,
                     and blending sounds into words.
                  </p>
                  <p>The end-goal is for the learners to be emergent readers and writers. This goal is strengthened through forged
                     school-home partnership.

                  <h4> Science</h4>
                  <p>This program helps the learners understand the various phenomena in their environment by learning through
                     discovery to develop their observation and logical skills. It also aims to promote the learners’ curiosity,
                     sensitivity, awareness, and appreciation of the things around them.

                  <h4> Writing</h4>
                  <p>Early writing practice builds skills on and off the page. Writing is an essential skill which learners can
                     benefit from for the rest of their lives. Writing in the Pre-Elementary is introduced and practiced
                     through age-appropriate engaging activities.

                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In achieving these aims, learners are engaged to light physical activities like simple stretching, jumping,
                     doing action songs, simple exercises, and playing games.

                  <p> This program exposes the learners to the Chinese culture through various forms of literature. It aims to
                     build the learners’ vocabulary as they are introduced in the listening, picture reading, and trace-writing
