                  <h3>Class Periods and Learning Cycle</h3>
                  <p>PYCS, as it is highly engaged to improve the learners’ study habit and learning commitment took the
                     first big step to embrace the six (6)-day learning cycle. Yuh Chiauians will be counting the days of
                     school year as part of a new rotating six-day learning cycle. With this new class schedule, the biggest
                     advantages are consistency, continuity of learning, flexibility, and shorter periods.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <h3>Enrollment Period and Opening of Classes</h3>
               <p>Private schools may modify the calendar to suit their context as long as the appropriate DepEd Regional
                  Officer, as the case may be, is informed in advance of any modification and the school opening date and
                  the minimum number of class hours and class days are observed.
               </p>
               <p>Private schools may, therefore, adopt their calendar as long as the following are observed:</p>
               <div class="enrollment-list">
                  <div class="row">
                     <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12">
                        <ul>
                           <li><i class="ri-number-1">. </i>The opening of classes is within the released DepEd Order for the current school year;</li>
                           <li><i class="ri-number-2">. </i>The calendar consists of not less than the number of school days stated in the DepEd school calendars;</li>
                           <li><i class="ri-number-3">. </i>The DepEd regional officer is notified of the school’s modified calendar not later than fifteen (15) days before the opening of the school term.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </div>

               <div id="enrollment-class-size" class="section-paragraph">
                  <h3>Enrollment and Class Size</h3>
                  <p>The enrolment and class size in every subject of each private school shall be determined by the School
                     Principal taking into account the total absorption capacity of its facilities, level of instruction, the nature
                     of the subject, and such other factors as may be conducive to the learning process.
                  </p>
                  <p>From a psychological viewpoint – in terms of how learners learn – what matters is the number of
                     learners who are physically present actively interacting among themselves and with the teacher.
                  </p>
                  <p>PYCS, as a private Filipino-Chinese school has a right to set the class size limit.</p>
