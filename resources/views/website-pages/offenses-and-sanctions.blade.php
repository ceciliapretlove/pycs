                  <p>Probation is a period of supervision over a learner offender. A learner offender on probation is ordered

                     the supervision of the POD officer or assigned personnel. During this testing period, a learner offender
                     faces the threat of being grounded or suspended if found continuously violating the rules and regulations
                     of the school. Below are the offenses that call for a learner offender to be under probation:
