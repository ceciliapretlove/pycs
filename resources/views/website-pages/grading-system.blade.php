                  <p>Grading system helps learners figure the amount of knowledge they have gained. It is also a method
                     used to assess learners’ educational performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>The <em>Averaging System</em> of grading as mandated by the Department of Education. This means that the
                     <strong>final rating</strong> in each discipline is computed by taking the average of the grades obtained from the first to
                     fourth quarters. A school year is divided into four (4) grading periods called quarters. A <em>Transmutation
                     Table</em>, also prescribed by the Department of Education, is used to compute for the final quarterly grades
                     of the learners, and that all grades shall be expressed in whole numbers. It is in the same manner that the
                     <strong>general weighted average</strong> or <strong>GWA</strong> is computed.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>N.B.</strong><em>(RMRPSBE; Sec. 144)</em><br>Although mandatory for the public schools, private schools have <em>discretion whether to adopt the same or
                     not</em>. Private school may adopt their own grading system as long as the basic requirement that the academic
                     grades are <strong>solely</strong> based on scholastic performance is strictly complied with. Also, there shall be established
                     policy stipulated in a manual.

                  <p>A report card or SF 9 communicates a learner’s performance academically. It is an official document
                     issued by the school to the learner’s parent and/or guardian at the close of each quarter, to keep the
                     parents and/or guardians posted on the learner’s performance and behavior in school. The report card is
                     released during the Parent-Teacher Consultation and returned to the class adviser not later than three (3)
                     days after issuance.
