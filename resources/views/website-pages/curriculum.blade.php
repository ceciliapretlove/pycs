               <h3>Pre-Elementary</h3>
               <p>The early years of a child offer a unique opportunity to shape his development. Four to six (4 – 6) year-
                  old learners gather to learn what sounds letters make to counting to 10, they develop appreciation of the
                  things around them through discovery, and by the time they get to Kindergarten, they should be ready to
                  speak and write in longer phrases and sentences, and by the time they graduate from Kindergarten, they
                  will have learned a lot. In addition to academics and social skills, PYCS’ Pre-Elementary curriculum
                  works on critical writing, speech, and fine motor skills.
               </p>
               <p>The Pre-Elementary Education of Philippine Yuh Chiau School, Inc. provides both academic and
                  personal programs that will prepare the learners in the formal schooling. The various program offerings
                  provide learning experiences to develop basic literacy, numeracy, scientific, and social skills which are
                  developmentally appropriate to the very young learners.
               </p>
               <h5>NUMERACY</h5>
               <p>Numeracy is about basic number concepts and skills generally emerge before school entry. It is important to
                  promote the development of these competencies in very young learners because these competencies are often
                  predictive of learners’ future school achievement.
               </p>
               <p>Supplementing how learners apply numeracy concepts and skills are through everyday activities like
                  counting, looking at shapes, and talking about sizes. The numeracy skills are also developed through play
                  and singing number songs.
