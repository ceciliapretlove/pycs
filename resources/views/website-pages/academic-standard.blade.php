                  <p>Assessment is the gathering of information about learning. It can be used for formative purposes – to
                     adjust instruction – or summative purposes; to render a judgement about the quality of work. One of the
                     major purposes of assessment is to provide feedback to learners. And it is a key instructional activity,
                     and teachers engage in it every day in a variety of informal and formal ways.

                  <h4>Culminating Activities or Performance Tasks</h4>
 <p>A <em>Culminating Activity</em> is a learning activity or assessment that asks learners to perform to demonstrate
                  their knowledge, understanding, and proficiency. Culminating Activities yield a tangible product and /
                  or performance that serve as evidence of learning. Culminating Activity calls for learners to apply their
                  learning in context. To make learning meaningful and memorable, culminating activities should be
                  interesting to the learners, age-appropriate, within their experience, and well connected to the important
                  content, process, and skills enveloped in the curriculum.
