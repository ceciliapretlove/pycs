               <h3>ESM Intensive Program</h3>
               <p>Philippine Yuh Chiau School, Inc. paves way to another avenue of honing the innate and developed
                  skills of the learners in the fields of Science, Mathematics, and Language. The Yuh Chiauians set their
                  academic standing in the top priority; hence, they really give importance to their academic class hours.
                  To relieve the learners from worrying about missed learning and assessment activities during trainings
                  and workshops in preparation for organized local, national, and international competitions, the school
                  designed the <em>ESM Intensive Program.</em>

                  <h4>Objective</h4>
               <p>The <em>Intensive Program</em> is designed to cater the needs of the learners who excel in Science, Mathematics,
                  and Language. The program aims to focus on the learners from Grade School to Junior High School who
                  have the <strong>final rating of 95 and above</strong> in the specifically mentioned disciplines.

                  Knowledge already acquired by the learners, and to intensively prepare the learners for different
                  competitions relating to science, mathematics, and language.
