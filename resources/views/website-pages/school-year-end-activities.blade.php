                  <h4>SCHOOL YEAR-END ACTIVITIES</h4>
                  <p>The Year-End Activities like Recognition Program, Moving-Up Program, and Commencement
                     Exercises are considered to be the “must” programs to celebrate every time each school year comes to
                     close.
                  </p>
                  <p>These are the highlight events when learners are proudly recognized of their well-earned awards. With
                     the set schedule as stipulated in school calendar, learners together with their supportive parents and
                     friends go up the stage and receive the product of their hard work for the whole school year.

                  <h4>Recognition Program</h4>
                  <p>                  
                     Studies have shown that learners who receive awards and recognition are often encouraged to continue
                     striving for higher academic achievement. Learners feel good about the effort they are giving when they
                     are rewarded for good performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>This program is for Nursery 1-2, Grades 1-5, Grades 7-9, and Grade 11.</p>

                  <p>                  
                     In accordance with the Kto12 educational system, learners will observe the Moving-Up ceremony
                     instead of the traditional graduation. This paves way for their entry to Grade School for Kindergarten
                     completers and Senior High School for Grade 10 completers.

                  <h4>Graduation Program/Commencement Exercises</h4>
                  <p>                  
Graduation is the traditional end-of-school year rites marking the accomplishment of a particular
educational stage to begin a new one. This is the reason why the ceremony is called Commencement
Exercises as commence means <em>to begin</em>. The grade 6 graduates will begin their academic journey in their
Junior High School, and the Grade 10 to begin their academic journey as they set their best foot forward
in their Senior High School years.
